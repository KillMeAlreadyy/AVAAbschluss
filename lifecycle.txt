Please note that at the end of the versionâ€™s lifecycle, technical support will be provided as far as practical but will be limited to usage and configuration questions in most cases.  We will address specific technical problems as far as possible, however to achieve a timely solution we may advise that an update to a recent DocuWare version is required as discontinued DocuWare versions can no longer receive updates or hotfixes. 

Support for DocuWare 7.3 will be limited to general trouble-shooting and hot fix packs already published.
