Terminal Server Warning when installing Desktop apps.


Question:
Why am I receiving a terminal server warning when installing the Desktop apps from a non-terminal server environment?

Answer:
By product design, when installing DocuWare Desktop Apps in a Windows server environment you will receive this warning. This occurs because Windows server environments by default are terminal servers.
In environments which are not windows servers, a check against the registry will be done to determine if it's a terminal server or not.
