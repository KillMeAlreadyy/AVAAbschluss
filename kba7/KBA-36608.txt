Question:
How do you enable Debug logging for User Sync V2 in DocuWare Cloud?

Answer:
To enable Debug logging for Cloud User Sync V2, we will need to access the .config file for this App. 

Please open "C:\Program Files (x86)\DocuWare\User Synchronization" and locate the file named "DocuWare.ADSync.exe.config."


Navigate through the file until you see the highlighted area below.


Change the "Error" value to "Debug" as highlighted below.


Save this file to apply the changes in the log level then run the User Sync to create the Debug log.

The debug log should now be found in C:\ProgramData\DocuWare\Logs.

After creating the debug logs, it is necessary to adjust the DocuWare.ADSync.exe.config file back to "Error" , save and close it .
