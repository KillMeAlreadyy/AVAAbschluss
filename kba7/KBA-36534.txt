Cloud Storage Notifications : Who and When

Views: 243
Question:
Who gets the Cloud Storage notifications and when?

Answer:
When certain storage limits are reached or exceeded, DocuWare automatically sends email notifications to the organization administrator and the ADP contact. This applies in each case when 85%, 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100% of the storage limit is reached or exceeded.

When 85% of the storage limit is reached or exceeded, these notifications go to the ADP contact for indirect customers, and to the organization administrator for direct customers.
When 90%, 95%, 99%, and 100% of the storage limit is reached or exceeded, the notifications go to the organization administrator and ADP contact for indirect customers, and only to the organization administrator for direct customers.
Notifications are sent when the remaining storage volume is less than 100 days. The calculation is based on the storage behavior of the last 30 days.
