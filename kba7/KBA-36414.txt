Changes in the Admin Tool Cannot be saved



Behavior:
When attempting to save changes in the DocuWare Administration Tool, you receive the following error:
"cannot save changes, please see logging for details"
Additionally, when trying to add an additional Organization, you receive the error: 
"Object Reference Not Set to an Instance of an Object"
Solution:
This is due to a mismatch between settings dlls files in the Admin Tool folder and the Web\Settings folder. To fix this issue, do the following:

Please navigate to "C:\Program Files\DocuWare\Web\Settings\bin" and copy these 4 dlls selected in the picture below.


	 
Then go to C:\Program Files (x86)\DocuWare\Admin Tool Online and paste them there.

Restart your DocuWare Administration Tool. Saving changes or adding an additional organization should now work without error.
KBA applicable for On-premise Organizations ONLY.
