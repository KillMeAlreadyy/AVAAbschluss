ERROR: "Cannot find Active Authentication Server" when on Configurations page



Behavior:
When trying to access the Configurations page on a multi-server environment, you receive the error:

"Login failed: Cannot find active Authentication server. All servers are either stopped or the communication channel settings don't allow a connection"

You've verified that all DocuWare services are in a "Running" state.

Solution:
In order to fix this error, please execute the following;

Navigate to the drive where DocuWare web components are installed and go to "Program Files\Web\Settings\bin" then edit the "DocuWare.WAFServices.settings" file.
***NOTE: Make a copy of this file before making any changes!***


Change the Authentication Server name from "localhost" to the server name where the DocuWare Authentication Service is currently running.


	 
Perform an IISRESET and accessing the configurations page should now be successful.
