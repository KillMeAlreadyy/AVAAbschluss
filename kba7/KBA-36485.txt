Authentication Server does not appear registered in Administration



​​​​​Scenario:
You have a multi-server DocuWare system with SSL enabled on all communication channels. A new Authentication Server was installed but you cannot enable SSL. In DocuWare Administrator, the Service options are blank and the server status is "Stopped".


Solution:
This is a result of  the DocuWare Administration Tool having SSL enabled but the new Authentication Server does not. The "NotSecure" communication channel needs to be enabled in the "DocuWare.Administration.exe.settings" file.
This setting file would be located in C:\Program Files (x86)\DocuWare\AdminTool. You simply need to make sure "NotSecure" is set to "true";



Once this change has been made, we can restart DocuWare Administration and the Service options will be filled in as intended.



You can then set up SSL as the communications channels, choose the certificate, and SSL would now be enabled on the new Authentication Server.

Now we must revert "NotSecure" back to "false" in the DocuWare.Administration.exe.settings file.



Finally, restart the new Authentication Server service. DocuWare Administration will now recognize the new Authentication Server and SSL will be enabled.
