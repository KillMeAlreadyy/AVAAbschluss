Which DocuWare module needs a Client License?







Question:
Which DocuWare module needs a Client License?

Answer:
The DocuWare modules listed in the picture below are all require a client license.
However, it is possible to login with the same DocuWare User, on the same device (+ an additional mobile device) on all these DocuWare modules with only one client license.

Note:
In order to use only one client license in the Web Client and/or the URL integration both modules have to be started in the same browser.


The license need of the DocuWare Desktop are:

DocuWare Printer         no Client License needed
DocuWare Import         no Client License needed
DocuWare Web Scan   no Client License needed
Smart Connect 

Smart Search   → uses the URL integration, which requires one client license
Smart Index          no Client License needed



Please note that you have to install the latest HotfixPack for the differnet DocuWare versions, only with the HotFixPack we can guarantee the described behavior.
