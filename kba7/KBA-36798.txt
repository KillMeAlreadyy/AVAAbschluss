Are Storage locations Supported?


Question:
Are Storage locations supported?
 
Answer:
DocuWare supports a broad spectrum of storage media for storing documents. This includes local hard disks, (virtual) network storage media, and external storage systems. 
Storage locations are considered external components. Therefore, the configuration and maintenance of these storage locations are the responsibility of the end user and is outside of our standard Support contract.
