How to enable Debug logging for Cloud Workflow Designer


Question:
How do you enable Debug logging for Workflow Designer in DocuWare Cloud?

Answer:
To enable Debug logging for Cloud Workflow Designer, we will need to access the .config file for Workflow Designer. 

Please open "C:\Program Files (x86)\DocuWare\Workflow Designer" and locate the file name "DocuWare.Bpw.Designer.exe.config."


Navigate through the file until you locate the highlighted area below.


Change the "Error" value to "Debug" as highlighted below.


Once this is completed,  save this file to apply the changes in the log level. 

Use the Workflow Designer to create the debug log. The debug log should now be found in this location C:\ProgramData\DocuWare\Logs\Bpw.

After creating the debug logs, it is necessary to adjust the DocuWare.Bpw.Designer.exe.config file back to "Error," save and close it.
