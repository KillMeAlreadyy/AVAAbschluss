DocuWare Version 7 Update



Starting with DocuWare 7, Updates are integrated in the DocuWare installation packages.
Therefore, to get the latest version of an Update you need to download the complete DocuWare setup files again.

Before you install the Update, please read and follow the Update installation instructions!

Please check the following information before updating to DocuWare 7.0:
If you plan to update to a later version than DocuWare 7.0 or plan to use DocuWare 7.0 only for a short time, please use the updated DocuWare 7.1 setup instead.
We have greatly improved the DocuWare 7.1 setup and were able to add many checks for the workflow database.
These checks prevent errors when upgrading to 7.1 and provide improved database integrity validation and will result in a better upgrade experience for all later upgrades.
If you need to use DocuWare 7.0 and will not upgrade to any newer DocuWare version in the foreseeable future, make sure to check the dwworkflowengine database connection and database before running the DocuWare 7.0 setup at all.
Additional dwworkflowengine database checks might be added to DocuWare 7.1 setup in the future, but will not be available to DocuWare 7.0 Setups due to technical reasons.
For the suggested upgrade path, please refer to https://support.docuware.com/en-us/knowledgebase/article/KBA-34774
