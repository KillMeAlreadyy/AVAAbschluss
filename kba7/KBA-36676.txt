Chrome continuously prompts to install Desktop apps to use any feature.



Behavior: 
After updating Google Chrome, Chrome continuously prompts me to install DocuWare Desktop apps to use any features.
Solution:
Please refer to the following post as it details the recent security changes that have been implemented in Chrome, which may cause issues with DocuWare Desktop apps. 
Chrome browser security change: Time to switch to HTTPS
The following work around can be applied until the needed changes are made to your DocuWare system;

On your workstation, open a Chrome browser and paste the following into the web address bar: chrome://flags/#unsafely-treat-insecure-origin-as-secure
	 
Enter your DocuWare URL into the text box, then select "Enabled" from the drop down list to the right. 

Once completed, restart your Chrome browser and try again as this issue should be resolved.
