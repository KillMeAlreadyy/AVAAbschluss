Change "UseOcrForNativepdf"


Behavior: Documents imported, scanned, or printed via DocuWare Desktop apps do not index correctly. When one click indexing is utilized it returns number and symbols. 
Solution:Broken text-shots can cause documents that were brought into DocuWare via Desktop Apps to be read incorrectly. You can set the value" UseOcrForNativepdf" to true which forces a brand new text-shot to be created.
