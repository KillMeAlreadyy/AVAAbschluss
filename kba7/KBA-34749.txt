DocuWare Desktop: Login Token expired







Behavior:
In Desktop Apps you get the error message: "Login Token is expired"

Solution:
There are two different possible causes for this error message:

The first cause is on client side and occurs only if the user didn’t use DocuWare Desktop on his client for a specific time. This can be "fixed" by increasing the value for parameter "MultiUsageTokenLifetime" in
	...\DocuWare\Authentication Server\DWAuthenticationServer.exe.settings 
	The default value is 14 days in 6.7 and 28 days since 6.8.

	This behavior typically happens on terminal server farms. See also the following article:
How to set up Desktop Apps in terminal server environment
	 
The second cause is on server side. The token for Job Server expires. This is basically a bug which was fixed with HotfixPack 32 for 6.8 resp. HotfixPack 02 for 6.9


If you want to extend all the already created token until the end of this year, perform the following steps:

Open your database management tool
Go to database DWSystem table DWUserTokenIdentity
Run this SQL statement:
UPDATE dwusertokenidentity SET expiration = '2018-12-31 23:00:00'
