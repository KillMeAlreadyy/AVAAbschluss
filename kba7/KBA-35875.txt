How to increase the number of CPU cores utilized by DocuWare Desktop OCR



Question:
How to increase the number of CPU cores that OCR uses on a client machine for DocuWare Import, Scanner or Printer?
 
Answer:
When you install DocuWare Desktop Apps on a client machine there is a settings file created specifying the parameters of OCR. Adjusting a certain value in this file will result in OCR utilizing up to a maximum of 4 cores on a client machine regardless of the size or amount of documents being processed by DocuWare Import, Scanner or Printer.


Navigate to where DocuWare Desktop Apps are installed on your client machine. The example below shows the location of the installed Desktop Apps on the C drive.

"C:\Program Files(x86)\DocuWare\Desktop"
Make a backup of the file named "DesktopOcr.settings", rename the backup file's extension to .bak
Edit the file in Notepad
Locate the value labeled "MaxCount"
Change this value from -1 to 4



  </OcrProviders>
  <ProcessPool OcrProcessCapacity="100" MaxCount="4" MinCount="0" TimeoutForProcesses="600000"/>
  <Logging />
</OcrServiceSettings>



Restart the DocuWare Desktop Service and the Docuware Desktop Apps
