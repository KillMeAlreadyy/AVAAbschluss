Additional Information: An ODBC file cabinet can be open in any version of DocuWare. DocuWare 5 thick client (Windows client) is a hybrid version that can act like a DocuWare 4 client. In other words, you can register or create any DocuWare 4 ODBC file cabinet with a DocuWare 5.x thick client. This will facilitate the conversion from DocuWare 4 ODBC type file cabinet to any version of DocuWare 5/6.x.
